# handwritten-digit-recognition-using-knn

This project presents a functional module that demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to handwritten digit classification.  
The system reads pixel data from a handwritten digits dataset, processes the data, trains a KNN model, and predicts unseen samples accurately.

The goal is to highlight key concepts of KNN classification, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

# How it Works

1.Load the handwritten digit dataset from CSV files
2.Normalize the pixel values for better model performance.
3.Split the data into training and testing sets.
4.Train a KNN classifier using the training data.
5.Predict labels for the test data.
6.Evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Image (as pixels) ➔ Normalize ➔ KNN Model ➔ Predict Digit ➔ Measure Accuracy

# - Model Accuracy: ~98% on the test dataset.
