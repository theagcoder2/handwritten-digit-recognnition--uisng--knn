# handwritten-digit-recognnition-using-knn

This project presents a functional module that demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to handwritten digit classification.  
The system reads pixel data from a handwritten digits dataset, processes the data, trains a KNN model, and predicts unseen samples accurately.

The goal is to highlight key concepts of KNN classification, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
